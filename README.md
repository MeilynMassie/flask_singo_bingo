## DESCRIPTION
A game inspired by Jackbox TV and Bingo. Each player will connect to a host device (laptop or smart TV) with their own personal device. On each personal device a bingo card will generated. It will be full of songs instead of the standard cells such as B2. Each bingo card is generated through SpotiPy API. You can pick any SpotiPy playlist you want, and it will generate the cards with the song titles based on which playlist you pick. It will also use the API to play the music for about 15 seconds to give you time to guess the song. In addition you will get 5 seconds of silence for any after thoughts. First to get bingo wins!

This game is currently only single player. Multiplayer will be implemented later. There are many bugs to find and squash.
