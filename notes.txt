NAMING CONVENTIONS 
HTML Tags: all lowercase with hyphens between words (ex: singo-bingo)
All Other Files: Lower Camel Case (ex: singoBingo)
JSON Tag Names: all lowercase with underscores between words (ex: signo_bingo)

PSYCOPG2 NUANCES
- Single params in DB have to have trailing comma. Python will interpert as an int 
  instead of tuple which is needed to run in db 


MAKEFILE NOTES
- .PHONY: In case the command is the name of a file
- &: Runs the next line immediately instead of waiting for it to close
- Doesn't run in venvs so you have to specify in the command
